Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM) Data Engineering Project

This project utilizes my data engineering skills to address certain business challenges facing a hypothetical food delivery startup called Acme Gourmet Meals (AGM). Notebooks 1.1-1.6 are meant to identify AGM's best customers. In this first part of the project, I have expanded my Github knowledge, designed queries using a data model in Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) format, used secondary datasets to enhance primary datasets. designed and created various data visualizations, wrote functional programming code with Python and SQL, worked with the Linux command line, operated virtual machines on the AWS cloud, worked with Docker containers, and proposed ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify best customers.
