    "# 1.6 Ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify best customers\n",

    "# How the 3 Metrics - Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value - can Identify Best Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "Recency refers to how recently a customer made a purchase. To determine recency, we can join the customers and sales tables on customer_id, group by the customer_id, and apply the maximum aggregate function on the sale_date column to get the latest or most recent sale date for a customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency, which is how often a customer purchases, can be obtained by joining together customers and sales on customer_id and taking the average of the differences between successive sale_date times for each customer. This is a valid approach since the average differences between successive sale_date times gives us a sense of when a customer will purchase from the company again after a given sale and time with the same customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monetary value, which captures information on how much a customer spends, can be obtained by information from the customers and sales tables. We can join the customers and sales tables on customer_id and find the total amount of money a particular customer spends for all relevant sales sales. This can be accomplished by grouping by customer_id and applying the sum aggregate on the total_amount column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to value customers who have made a recent purchase, buy frequently, and spend more. To get recency into a meaningful number, we can take the difference between the current date and each customer's most recent sale date. The average of differences between successive sales can be used as a good metric of frequency dating back to 2 years. The 2 year timeframe allows us to account for customers who make expensive purchases from the company, which might occur at larger intervals. The total sales amount for each customer is a good indicator of a customer's monetary value. Weighting these factors equally (giving each metric a weight of 1/3) will lessen the influence of certain customers who weigh heavily in one area but very low in all others. These are customers such as those who purchased a high-priced item awhile ago but have not been consistent or those who made a transaction out of curiosity and never plan on being a long-term customer. Additionally, since the scale of a metric might be naturally higher than the others, we will need to normalize each of the metrics so that the numerical values for recency, frequency, and monetary value are of similar scale. This will prevent the scoring from preferring one metric more than the others, which is what we want when we want to value frequency, recency, and monetary value. The result will be a weighted sum of recency, frequency, and monetary value scores for each customer. The higher the weighted sum, the more valuable the customer.\n",
